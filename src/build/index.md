description: Build the disaster.radio hardware.

The disaster.radio hardware is still under development. 

Our first prototypes had a few bugs and we're currently working on a fixed design. It is entirely feasible to build your own disaster.radio. Most parts are readily available via online retailers.

The source code, custom circuit board layout schematics and enclosure design is all available [on our github repo](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio).
